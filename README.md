## 👋🏼 Hello!

I'm Keith Kurson (he/him). I'm looking for my next role 👀, previously a staff engineer + manager at [Glitch](https://glitch.com) and [Fastly](https://fastly.com) working to make building the internet easier and more fun. Previously I was an engineering lead at [Nava PBC](https://navapbc.com) leading projects to build a more equitable safety net in America. Sometimes I code in my spare times for organizations like the [United States Digital Response](https://github.com/usdigitalresponse/neighbor-express) but mostly for fun 💕.
